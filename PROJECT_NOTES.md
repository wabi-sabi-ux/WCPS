# Web Based Claims Processing System (WCPS)

## ‚úÖ Completed
- ASP.NET Core MVC project scaffolded.
- Identity setup with Register/Login/Logout.
- Claims system:
  - Employee can create claim with PDF upload.
  - Employees can view their own claims.
  - Claims list polished (badges, search, preview modal).
- Admin system:
  - CPD Admin role added.
  - AdminEmployees CRUD (with BankAccountNumber).
  - AdminClaims (pending claims list, process page with audit trail).
- Audit Trail tracking for claim actions.
- BankAccountNumber added to employee model and views.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Fixes Applied
- `AdminProcessViewModel` updated so display-only fields (`Title`, `ClaimRef`, `EmployeeName`) are optional, fixing validation issues on Process POST.
- Confirm download modals added for receipts.
- Polished employee & admin claim tables.

## üöÄ Next Priorities
1. Polish AdminClaims Index (consistent with employee UI).
2. Finish Employee CRUD polish (validation, optional export).
3. Improve Admin Process UX (history inline, confirm dialogs).
4. Dashboard/Reporting (counts, totals, charts).
5. Testing & QA (edge cases, invalid file uploads).
6. Documentation & GitHub push:
   - README with build/run instructions.
   - Commit & push to GitHub with screenshots.
